# Smart Cache Layer — Guided Activity

**Course:** Advanced Python Programming | ALU BSE  
**Topic:** Caching  
**Duration:** ~30 minutes  
**File to work in:** `blog/views.py`

---

## Overview

You have been given a working Django REST API for a blog platform with 500 posts
and 3 users. The API works — but it hits the database on **every single request**.

Your job is to add a smart cache layer, level by level, until the API is fast,
correct, and secure.

---

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo and enter the directory
git clone <repo-url>
cd smart-cache-activity

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run migrations and seed the database
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py seed

# 5. Start the server
python manage.py runserver
```

You should see output confirming 500 posts and 3 users created:
```
✅ Created user: alice / password123
✅ Created user: bob / password123
✅ Created user: carol / password123
✅ Created 500 posts
```

## The Endpoints

| Method | URL | What it does | Auth required? |
|--------|-----|--------------|----------------|
| GET | `/api/posts/` | All published posts | No |
| GET | `/api/posts/<id>/` | Single published post | No |
| POST | `/api/posts/` | Create a new post | Yes |
| GET | `/api/posts/my-drafts/` | Your own drafts only | Yes |
| GET | `/api/posts/broken-drafts/` | Buggy draft view | Yes |

---

## Level 1 — Feel the Pain (5 min)

Before writing any cache code, run the timing script to record your baseline:

```bash
# Make sure the server is running in another terminal first
python timing.py
```

**Record your results here:**

| Endpoint | First Request | Average |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| All Posts | 46.7ms | 33.4ms |
| Single Post | 2.7ms | 1.6ms |

You'll run this again after each level to see how much you've improved.

---

## Level 2 — Cache the Public Data (15 min)

Open `blog/views.py` and find the `PostListView` and `PostDetailView` classes.

Follow the TODO comments to implement **cache-aside** for both endpoints.

**The pattern you are implementing:**
```
Request comes in
    ↓
Check cache → HIT?  → Return cached data immediately (fast ⚡)
    ↓ MISS
Query database
    ↓
Store result in cache
    ↓
Return data to user
```

**Tools available:**
```python
from django.core.cache import cache

cache.get("your-key")                      # returns None if not found
cache.set("your-key", data, timeout=300)   # stores data for 300 seconds
```

**When you're done**, run `python timing.py` again and compare.

> **Discussion:** What cache key did you choose for the list endpoint?
> Compare with a classmate — did you choose the same key? Why or why not?

---

## Level 3 — Protect Personal Data (15 min)

Now find the `MyDraftsView` class and implement caching for the `/my-drafts/` endpoint.

**This one is different.** The drafts belong to a specific user — you must ensure
that **User A can never see User B's drafts**, even through the cache.

### Step 1 — Implement the cache

Follow the TODO in `MyDraftsView.get()`. Think carefully about your cache key.

### Step 2 — Find the bug

Look at `BrokenDraftsView` at the bottom of `views.py`.

**Do NOT fix the code.** Instead, answer these questions below:

---

**Bug Report**

> What is the bug in `BrokenDraftsView`?

_Answer:_ It caches every authenticated user's drafts under the same generic
key, `"my-drafts"`. The cache response is not tied to the authenticated user.

---

> Walk through this exact scenario — what happens step by step?
> 1. Alice logs in and calls `/api/posts/broken-drafts/`
> 2. Bob logs in and calls `/api/posts/broken-drafts/`

_Answer:_

1. Alice's request passes authentication and misses the initially empty
   `"my-drafts"` cache key. The view queries Alice's drafts, serializes them,
   and stores that list under `"my-drafts"` for 120 seconds.
2. Bob's request also passes authentication, but it hits the same
   `"my-drafts"` key. The view returns Alice's already-cached data without
   querying for Bob's drafts.

---

> What is the real-world impact of this bug if it shipped to production?

_Answer:_ This is a privacy and authorization failure: one customer can read
another customer's private draft titles and content. In production that can
expose confidential or unpublished information and cause compliance,
reputational, and legal harm.

---

> What is the one-line fix?

_Answer:_ Include the authenticated user's ID in the key, for example:
`cache_key = f"posts:my-drafts:{request.user.pk}"`.

---

## Level 4 — Invalidation (10 min)

You've now cached the post list. But there's a problem.

**Scenario:**
1. User requests `GET /api/posts/` — gets cached response (100 posts)
2. User creates a new post via `POST /api/posts/`
3. User requests `GET /api/posts/` again — **still sees 100 posts, not 101**

The cache doesn't know the data changed.

### Your task

Find the `post()` method in `PostListView` and add the one line of code
that fixes this problem after a new post is saved.

```python
cache.delete("your-key-here")   # removes the stale entry
```

**Test it:**
1. Call `GET /api/posts/` and note the count
2. Call `POST /api/posts/` to create a new post
3. Call `GET /api/posts/` again — the new post should appear

> **Discussion:** What's the difference between `cache.delete()` and
> updating the cache with the new data directly? When would you choose each?

---

## Stretch Goal — Query-Aware Cache Key

If you finish early, look at this scenario:

```
GET /api/posts/?status=published    # all published posts
GET /api/posts/?status=published&page=2   # page 2 only
```

If you used a single key like `"posts:all"` for both, they'd overwrite each other.

**Challenge:** Modify your `PostListView.get()` so that the cache key
accounts for any query parameters in the request.

```python
# Hint — something like this:
params = request.query_params.urlencode()   # turns params into a string
cache_key = f"posts:list:{params}"
```

---

## Final Check — Run the Timer One More Time

```bash
python timing.py
```

**Record your final results:**

| Endpoint | Before (Level 1) | After (Level 4) | Improvement |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| All Posts | 71.6ms | 5.9ms | 91.8% faster |
| Single Post | 2.7ms | 0.9ms | 66.7% faster |

---

## Reflection Questions

Answer these before the debrief:

1. Why did you use a **shared** key for `/api/posts/` but a **user-specific** key for `/my-drafts/`?

_Answer:_ Published posts are the same public representation for every
visitor, so a shared key safely maximizes reuse. Drafts are private and vary by
owner, so their key must include the authenticated user's stable ID.

2. What would happen if you set `timeout=None` on the post list cache?

_Answer:_ The cache entry would not expire automatically. It could serve stale
data indefinitely unless every relevant create, update, delete, publish, and
unpublish operation invalidated or replaced it correctly.

3. In what situation would caching `/my-drafts/` actually cause a bug even with the correct user-specific key?
   *(Hint: think about what happens when a user saves a new draft)*

_Answer:_ If a user creates, edits, publishes, or deletes one of their drafts
without invalidating their `posts:my-drafts:<user-id>` entry, they can receive
their own stale cached draft list until its 120-second timeout expires.

- [ ] Explain what cache-aside (lazy loading) means in your own words
- [ ] Design a cache key that is shared, user-specific, or query-aware as needed
- [ ] Explain why authentication must happen **before** the cache lookup
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation when underlying data changes
- [ ] Identify a cache key bug and explain its security impact
